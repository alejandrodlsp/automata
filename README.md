# Cellular Automata
A basic implementation of cellular automata model in my spare time as a test. It includes water cell behaviours, sand and static dirt cells.
This project is unclomplete and missing a lot of functionalities that I would like to add in a future revision.
Made using OpenGL with glfw and GLAD.
